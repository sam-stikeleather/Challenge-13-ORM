# Challenge-13-ORM

## Description

This project demonstrates the use of Object Relational Mapping (ORM) to create a back-end for an e-commerce site. It allows the user to view, add, update, and delete categories, products, and tags from a database.


## Usage

To use this application, clone the repository to your local machine, navigate to the root directory, and run `npm install` to install the dependencies. Then, run `npm run seed` to seed the database. Finally, run `npm start` to start the server. You can then use Insomnia Core to test the routes.
